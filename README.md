## My Projects
- [Teak's Tweaks](https://github.com/teakivy/teaks-tweaks), An actively developed Minecraft Plugin, with the original goal to replicate Vanilla Tweaks, but has since gone far beyond.
- [Pixel Art Image](https://github.com/teakivy/pixel-art-image) My own image format for Pixel Art that consistantly has a lower file size than PNG.
- [TSOS](https://github.com/teakivy/TSOS) An operational faux "Operating System" written in Typescript, React, & Electron.
- [DarkIvy](https://github.com/teakivy/DarkIvy) A custom VSCode purple theme.
- [TestLangScript](https://github.com/teakivy/TestLangScript) A VERY simple testing language created in Javascript, based on Javascript, and compiled to Javascript.
- [Optifine Installer](https://github.com/teakivy/OptiFine-Installer) An installer application for the Minecraft mod "Optifine" written in Typescript, React, & Electron.
- [TeakOS](https://github.com/teakivy/TeakOS) A new Operating System (written in Assembly & C) aiming to recreate various functions of the linux kernel & MS-DOS. The project is still very early in development, but already has a basic kernel & shell system. Opposing TSOS, TeakOS can (theoretically) run on actual x86 hardware, without the need for any external software, or bootloaders!
